# Probably How
A terrible markov chain app that aggregates WikiHow articles
by leveraging [bleeding edge](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) [AI](https://imgur.com/ZeSy3Zu)
to bring you the best instructional content available at your command line.

Created for the 2017
[Stupid Shit No One Needs & Terrible Ideas Hackathon](http://www.stupidhackathon.com/)
hosted at [NoiseBridge](https://noisebridge.net)
by [@eenblam](https://github.com/eenblam) and [@squigglydonut](https://github.com/squigglydonut).

## Installation
You should probably use a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)
or [something](https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html).
Maybe it works with Python 3, maybe it doesn't.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eenblam/probablyhow.git
cd probablyhow
python setup.py install
```
