# Probably How
A terrible markov chain app that aggregates WikiHow articles
by leveraging [bleeding edge](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) [AI](https://imgur.com/ZeSy3Zu)
to bring you the best instructional content available at your command line.

Created for the 2017
[Stupid Shit No One Needs & Terrible Ideas Hackathon](http://www.stupidhackathon.com/)
hosted at [NoiseBridge](https://noisebridge.net)
by [@eenblam](https://github.com/eenblam) and [@squigglydonut](https://github.com/squigglydonut).

## Installation
You should probably use a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)
or [something](https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html).
Maybe it works with Python 3, maybe it doesn't.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eenblam/probablyhow.git
cd probablyhow
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

```bash
$ howto turn off a banana
1: First, using a spatula.
2: Add the mashed bananas.
3: For some people, a banana until it is beaten.
4: Remove from the freezer.
5: Pack a lunch and strike out for a long time even if they are working on.
6: If you are not bad for you, but many people are bound to have a bitter taste and consistency.
7: Pinch just behind the blossom end to break it apart, then peel bits of it as it is, or you can use a spoon or spatula is too dry and crumbly, spritz it with a spiky decorators tip.
8: Make sure that the thinness determines the final two minutes, to avoid burning the banana first, then add it to a year.
